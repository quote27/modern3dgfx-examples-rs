modern 3d graphics examples
====================
A rust implementation of the examples from [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/).

Note: Missing some examples from chapter 6 due to accidentally doing a hard reset in git when trying to go to an older example.

The shader files can be found with the source of the book [here](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/Building%20the%20Tutorials.html).
